Whether it’s a startup vibe or the big league MNCs, I’ve been there, leading teams and making clients happy with solid tech solutions. When I’m not coding, you’ll catch me pumping iron, cruising on my bike, or chasing that coffee high. Just a regular day for me, living it up one line of code at a time!`,
